        <p><em>I dont actually have a <strong>title.</strong></em></p>  
        <p>I am a jack of all trades master of none. Many of my hobbies include building and flying my own drones, various projects involving a 3d printer, emulating old games on drastically different types of hardware, and now i want to be able to build website applications for my own personal use such as workout tracking, project tracking and what im assuming is going to be my new blog. I've never considered myself to be a social person, quite the opposite in fact.</p>
